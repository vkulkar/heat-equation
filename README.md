This matlab code solves the 1D heat equation numerically. It is based on the Crank-Nicolson method. This problem is taken
from "Numerical Mathematics and Computing", 6th Edition by Ward Cheney and David Kincaid and published by Thomson Brooks/Cole
2008. The method is based on a finite difference approximation to the ODE and is cast into a matrix equation of the form Ax = b
, which is solved for at each time step. The grid spacing and time step may be changed to explore the sensitivity of the
numerical solution.
